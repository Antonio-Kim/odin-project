    <h1>Goulash</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      One of my all-time favorite comfort food meals growing up was the beef
      goulash they served in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of buttered
      white bread and a carton of milk. Little did I know that it wasn't really
      goulash, but an Americanized version, invented to stretch a small amount
      of beef into enough food for a not-so-small family. This is one of those
      very simple dishes that does not taste simple--perfect for your weeknight
      dinner rotation.

      <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salted</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 quart chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce can diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>1/4 cups chopped Italian parsley</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded white Cheddar chees</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and ground beef.
        Cook, breaking the meat into small pieces, until browned, about 5
        minutes. Cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes more.
        Add garlic, salt, black pepper, cayenne, paprika, Italian seasoning, and
        bay leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir until flavors come together, about 3 minutes. Pour in
        chicken broth, diced tomatoes, and marinara sauce. Rinse out the jar
        with 1 cup water and pour into the pot. Add soy sauce, stir, and bring
        soup to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and simmer to let flavors
        intensify, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase heat to medium-high and bring soup to a simmer. Add macaroni;
        simmer, stirring occasionally, until just barely tender, about 12
        minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove goulash from heat. Discard bay leaves; stir in parsley and
        Cheddar cheese. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Taste and season as
        desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
